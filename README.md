# 🛡️ Multi-Modal Email Spam Detection System (Text + Image) 📊

An advanced, end-to-end spam detection engine that goes beyond traditional text filtering. This system uses a **Late-Fusion AI Architecture** to analyze both email content and screenshots simultaneously, providing a robust defense against modern spam.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Traditional spam filters often fail when malicious content is embedded within images.  
This project bridges that gap by combining **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Computer Vision (CV)** to build a smarter detection system.

The system is integrated with a live **Analytical Dashboard** to provide real-time monitoring and data-driven insights.

---

## 🔍 Model Performance

The system is powered by two deep learning models:

- 🧠 **DistilBERT (Text Model)** → **99.10% Accuracy**  
- 🖼️ **MobileNetV2 (Image Model)** → **99.13% Accuracy**

---

## ⚙️ How It Works (Decision Logic)

| Scenario        | Text Model | Image Model | Final Decision |
|----------------|------------|------------|----------------|
| Both Flagged   | SPAM       | SPAM       | ❌ SPAM         |
| Either Flagged | SPAM/HAM   | HAM/SPAM   | ⚠️ SUSPICIOUS   |
| Both Safe      | HAM        | HAM        | ✅ HAM          |
